export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a dedicated individual who prioritises self development and continous growth. So far in my career, I have gained valuable personal and technical skills, that have led me to my passion of technology and areas of innovation. My career started as an Engineer, where I developed significant problem solving skills. However, due to my interests in technology, I made the leap to further learning by taking on a Computer Science degree. The past few years at university has allowed me to blend my creative abilities with problem solving and analytical thinking, allowing me to gain a passion for software development and data analytics. My part time roles of owning a small e-commerce business and team lead at Notts County have added to my personal skills that have been transferred into my development in the tech world. As a fresh graduate, I have dedicated the summer to sharpening my skills while seeking out the right opportunity.`;
